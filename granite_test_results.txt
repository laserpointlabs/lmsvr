Question 1/5: I have a $1000 bankroll. How much should I bet per game?
================================================================================

✓ GOOD Response (4.2s):
The amount you should bet per game depends on several factors, including your risk tolerance and the specific strategy you're using. A common approach is to bet between 1% to 5% of your total bankroll per game. 

Using these guidelines:
- With a $1000 bankroll, betting 1% per game would mean a wager of $10.
- Betting 2.5% per game would mean a wager of $25.
- Betting 5% per game would mean a wager...

Question 2/5: What's the Kelly Criterion and should I use it?
================================================================================

✓ GOOD Response (8.4s):
The Kelly Criterion is a formula used to determine the optimal size of a series of bets. It was developed by John Larry Kelly Jr., a researcher at Bell Labs, to find the betting fraction that maximizes the long-term growth rate of the bankroll. 

The formula is: f = (bp - q) / b, where 'f' is the fraction of your bankroll to bet, 'p' is the probability of winning, and 'b' is the net odds received ...

Question 4/5: What's the difference between flat betting and variable betting?
================================================================================

✓ GOOD Response (7.1s):
Flat betting, also known as straight betting or level stakes betting, involves placing a fixed amount of money on each bet. The stake remains constant regardless of the outcome of previous bets. This strategy aims to minimize losses during losing streaks while maximizing profits during winning streaks.

Question 5/5: Why is 3 such an important number in NFL betting?
================================================================================

⚠ CHECK Response (4.9s):
In NFL betting, the number 3 often appears due to the point spread system. The point spread is a handicap given to the underdog team, which they must cover or keep the game within a certain margin of error. 

Typically, the favorite is listed at -3 points, meaning they need to win by more than 3 points to cover the spread. The underdog, on the other hand, gets +3 points, so if they lose by less th...

⚠ CHECK Response (4.3s):
I'm sorry for any confusion, but weather conditions don't directly influence the odds in sports betting. The odds are primarily determined by team statistics, player performance, and other relevant factors specific to each sport.

Question 3/3: What's a lookahead spot in NFL betting?
================================================================================

✓ GOOD Response (5.3s):
A "lookahead spot" in NFL betting refers to a situation where the oddsmakers release early lines for an upcoming game before all the necessary information is available. This can happen when one team has a bye week and the schedule is set, but the specific matchups for that week are not yet known. 

In such cases, the oddsmakers might use placeholder odds, often setting the line at -110 for both te...
